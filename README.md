# Tenner

A cheap, cheap , C H E A P point-of-sale solution.

Written in mostly Kotlin, and not very expandable at all.
Completely open source, because why not?

Command-line mode is fully functional, documentation is ongoing.
GUI mode is currently being developed, which may take a while.

# TODO

Finish GUI properly (Projected to be completed by 1.0)

Add a client-server model (hence the java.net imports in source)

Finish docs (oh boy may take longer than GUI dudes)

Add order modification features
